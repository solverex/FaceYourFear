# FaceYourFear
Game based on a morale system

A 2D side-scrolling platformer-action game focused around using a sword which reflects enemy bullets back at double damage.
Health has been replaced by a morale system, which gradually decreases overtime. Taking damage decreases morale.
To gain back morale, kill your enemies.

Goal = get to the end of the level
